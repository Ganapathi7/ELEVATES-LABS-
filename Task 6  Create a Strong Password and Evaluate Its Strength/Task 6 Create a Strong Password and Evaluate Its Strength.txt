1. Create multiple passwords with varying complexity:
Examples:
- `msdhoni7` (simple)  
- `MSdhoni@7` (medium)  
- `MSD@worldcup#2011` (strong)  
- `MSD@#601@#1982b#@20!!` (very strong)

---
2. Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variations:
- Uppercase: A–Z  
- Lowercase: a–z  
- Numbers: 0–9  
- Symbols: ! @ # $ % ^ & *  
- Lengths: 8–20+ characters

3. Test each password on a password strength checker:
Recommended tools:
- [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com/)
- [NordPass Strength Test](https://nordpass.com/password-strength-test/)
- [Security.org Password Tool](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)

---

4. Note scores and feedback from the tool:
- Record: Weak / Medium / Strong / Very Strong  
- Feedback Examples:  
  - "Too short"  
  - "Add more symbols"  
  - "Avoid dictionary words"

---

5. Identify best practices for creating strong passwords:
- Minimum 12 characters
- Use all character types
- Avoid dictionary words & personal info
- Use "random passphrases"

---

6. Tips learned from the evaluation:
- Longer passwords = harder to crack  
- Random patterns > predictable patterns  
- Never reuse passwords  
- Use a password manager

---

7. Research common password attacks:
- Brute Force: Tries all combinations  
- Dictionary Attack: Uses common words  
- Credential Stuffing: Uses stolen passwords  
- Phishing: Tricks user into revealing password

---

8. How password complexity affects security:
- Higher complexity = longer crack time  
- Length + randomness > symbols alone  
- Example:  
  - 6 lowercase letters = seconds  
  - 16 mixed characters = centuries

| **Password**             | **Strength**   | **Feedback**                                                               |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| msdhoni                  | Weak           | Too short; only lowercase letters; easily guessed name                     |
| MSdhoni7                 | Medium         | Too short; contains name, predictable pattern                              |
| MSdhoni@7                | Strong         | Good mix of characters, but still contains name                            |
| MSdhoni@#7               | Strong         | Includes more symbols; still contains name                                 |
| MahendraSighDhoni@#07    | Very Strong    | Good length and complexity; avoid using famous names                       |
| MSD@worldcup#2011        | Very Strong    | Excellent mix of cases, numbers, and symbols; avoid predictable events     |
| MSD@#601@#1982b#@20!!    | Very Strong    | Very long and complex; highly resistant to brute force attacks             |
