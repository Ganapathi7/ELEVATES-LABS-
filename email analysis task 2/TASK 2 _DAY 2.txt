TASK 2 | DAY 2 | date : 05-08-2035

TITTLE : Analyze a phishing email sample.

 
1. Obtain a sample phishing email

Sample email :

CLIENTE PRIME - banco.bradesco@atendimento.com.br

email subject : 	CLIENTE PRIME - BRADESCO LIVELO: Seu cartão tem 92.990 pontos LIVELO expirando hoje!
Sender Display:	BANCO DO BRADESCO LIVELO banco.bradesco@atendimento.com.br
Recipient     :	phishing@pot
Date Sent     :	Tue, 19 Sep 2023 18:35:49 +0000
Originating IP:	137.184.34.4 (DigitalOcean server)
Email Encoding:	Base64
Message-ID    :	20230919183549.39DEA3F725@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-35gb-intel-sfo3-06


2. Examine sender's email address for spoofing

From: BANCO DO BRADESCO LIVELO <banco.bradesco@atendimento.com.br>

Spoofed domain: atendimento.com.br is not officially tied to Bradesco Bank.

Intent: Makes it look like it’s from Bradesco using deceptive branding.


3. Check email headers for discrepancies

SPF: TempError 

DKIM: None

DMARC: TempError

IP: 137.184.34.4

Tool used: MXToolbox + manual inspection.


4. Identify suspicious links or attachments

Found Malicious Link

Link in email button:
https://blog1seguimentmydomaine2bra.me/

Clearly not an official Bradesco domain.

Redirects to a phishing website posing as a login/reward page.


5. Look for urgent or threatening language

Example from body:
"Seu cartão tem 92.990 pontos LIVELO expirando hoje!"
(Your card has 92,990 Livelo points expiring today!)

This is a classic urgency tactic to trick users into clicking without thinking.


6. Note any mismatched URLs (hover to see real link)

Display text: Resgatar Agora (Redeem Now)

Hover reveals: https://blog1seguimentmydomaine2bra.me/

Does not match branding of Bradesco or Livelo → mismatch detected.


7. Verify presence of spelling or grammar errors


The Portuguese is mostly accurate, but tone and flow feel automated.

Slightly off formatting & overuse of bold/urgent phrasing in Brazilian Portuguese.

English emails often contain spelling/grammar errors — not the case here due to localization.



8. Summarize phishing traits found in the email
